# Abstract
This project aims to explore the integration of machine learning, socio-economic data, & geospatial analysis to identify and predict crime hotspots across all of the counties in the state of Florida. By utilizing historical crime data from the **Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE)** simultaneously with socio-economic factors from the **U.S. Census Bureau**, the study investigates how factors such as housing, education, and incomes correlate with crime rates.  

The methodology used in this project combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Correlation Analysis**, and **Machine Learning models** to uncover patterns and predict crime rates. Visualizations that were generated for thisstudy include regional distributions, actual crime rates heatmaps, predicted crime rates heatmaps, socio-economic factors heatmaps, and correlation matrices to support interpretability and data-driven insights. Spatial mapping was also used to provide an interactive representation of the crime trends across all counties.  

The resulting Github offers a reproducible platform for all types of stakeholders to explore findings and demonstrates how AI & data visualization can help to influence public safety strategies, policing strategies, and urban planning decisions.
