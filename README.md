# Abstract
This project aims to explore the integration of machine learning, socio-economic data, & geospatial analysis to identify and predict crime hotspots across all of the counties in the state of Florida. By utilizing historical crime data from the **Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE)** simultaneously with socio-economic factors from the **U.S. Census Bureau**, the study investigates how factors such as housing, education, and incomes correlate with crime rates.
