# Abstract
This project aims to explore the integration of machine learning, socio-economic data, & geospatial analysis to identify and predict crime hotspots across all of the counties in the state of Florida. By utilizing historical crime data from the **Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE)** simultaneously with socio-economic factors from the **U.S. Census Bureau**, the study investigates how factors such as housing, education, and incomes correlate with crime rates.  

The methodology used in this project combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Correlation Analysis**, and **Machine Learning modeling** to uncover patterns and predict crime rates. Visualizations that were generated for this study include regional distributions, actual crime rates heatmaps, predicted crime rates heatmaps, socio-economic factors heatmaps, and correlation matrices to support interpretability and data-driven insights. Spatial mapping was also used to provide an interactive representation of the crime trends across all counties.  

The resulting Github offers a reproducible platform for all types of stakeholders to explore findings and demonstrates how AI & data visualization can help to influence public safety strategies, policing strategies, and urban planning decisions. 

# Problem Statement
Crime has been a persistent public safety concern that impacts not only Florida, but all communities across the world. Traiditional approaches have been used to analuze crime trends, but they often lack the spatial and predictive depth needed to be able to predict future crime risks. Law enforcement agencies and policymakkers have stressed the need of tools that are able to go beyond traditional statistical methods to identify high-risk areas and address socio-economic conditions that may lead to an increase in crime activity.  

With the advancements being made in the **Data Science** field, the tools and methods available can help to provide a data-driven approach to crime prediction. Using historical crime data with county-level socio-economic factors and spatial analysis, this study aims to uncover patterns and relationships between crime types and socio-economic indicators. By applying machine learning modeling and geospatial visualizations, all predictions made are visualized to provide a better understanding of the relationships uncovered.
