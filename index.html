    <p class="mb-2">
    This capstone project was developed by Pedro Medina as part of the MS in Data Science program with a focus in Artificial Intelligence at Florida International University.
    The project applies machine learning and geospatial data analysis to predict crime hotspots across Florida counties.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
      By integrating historical crime data with socio-economic indicators such as poverty, employment, education, and housing, the project identifies patterns that can inform proactive safety measures.
      The work is supervised by Dr. Levente Juhasz of Florida International University and aims to showcase how AI models, combined with spatial insights, can enhance crime prediction and policy planning.

      This website provides an interactive overview of the project’s findings, visualizations, and methodology.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This project investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and geospatial data to predict and map crime hotspots across Florida. The core objective is to identify high-risk counties by analyzing historical crime records in conjunction with socio-economic indicators and spatial patterns. Through this approach, the project aims to enhance public safety insights and provide a framework for data-driven crime prevention strategies.

        <p>
          Data was collected for all <strong>67</strong> counties in Florida and grouped into three regional categories:
          <strong>North Florida</strong> <strong>(33 counties)</strong>, 
          <strong>Central Florida</strong> <strong>(12 counties)</strong>, and 
          <strong>South Florida</strong> <strong>(22 counties)</strong>. 
          The datasets span the years of 2015 to 2020.

      <!-- Approach -->

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Approach</h3>
        <p>
          After cleaning and transforming the datasets, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify trends, anomalies, and relationships between variables. Crime and socio-economic data were merged at the county level, enabling correlation analysis to uncover which factors were most predictive of crime.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The insights from EDA and correlation studies informed the selection of input variables for machine learning models. These models were designed to forecast potential crime hotspots and support spatial visualization of high-risk regions.
